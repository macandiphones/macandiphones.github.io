<p>My iPhone has been having issues with battery drain when Wi-Fi and cellular data is selected even when asleep. I think the best course of action in this case is to do a restore but I am worried about all the data on the iPhone including all my apps movies notes etc. If battery health has degraded significantly the below message will also appear. Well my iphone has stucked with the apple logo and the circle spining and i have searched over internet to fix iti have pushed the round button and the top one onoff togetherThe phone turned offThen ive connected iphone to itunes and i have choosed the option to put the iphone to the factory values or something like thatThis will erase. Your battery can still be used.</p>

An Apple Authorized Service Provider can replace the battery to restore full performance and capacity. Your battery can still be used. But when I turn off and on again it shows no battery level at all and requires charging which takes a lot of time to charge as well.
