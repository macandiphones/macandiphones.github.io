<p>Using a Lightning cable charging cable plug your iPhone into a power source such as your computer or wall charger. I dont want to buy a new phone straight away. If your iPhone XR battery stopped charging at 80 percent or below and it ever seems to get fully charged it might get slightly warmer when it charges. It has an indicator light in the bottom edges of Kindle devices. If youre charging your iPhone in a particularly warm location the iPhone will automatically stop the battery from charging past 80.</p>
