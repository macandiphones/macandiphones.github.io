<p>It started when iMessage group chats were better than MMS ones so people would leave Android users out so they could enjoy the group chat. Just switched from android to iPhone after 12 years of owning and working with android as a developer. Most users were likely not aware that when they open iMessage the default SMS application on their brand new iPhone and send a message to another user by phone number that the application is actually choosing between routing that message via iMessage through Apples backend or via SMS over their carriers network. Group chats become impossible with iphone users so you stop being invited. Max Weinbach maxwinebach.</p>
