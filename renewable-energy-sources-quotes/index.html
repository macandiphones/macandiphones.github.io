Renewable energy is about more than just electricity generation. The high temperature and pressure in Earths interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically. The sooner we switch away from carbon-based fuel and start relying on renewable energy sources available in the United States the sooner we will grow our economy by creating the millions of new jobs that will come from retrofitting homes and businesses building smart grids renewable energy systems and planting trees and all the rest.
