My end goal is to be using my unlocked iPhone with a UK sim card and UK phone number with my US number ported to Google Voice. A big complaint Ive seen is comparing photos and so they claim this phone takes poor focusing photos. The video quality is way better on Sony.</p>

<p>With this money they simply check the IMEI of the phone. Pros - oddly enough coming from iphone for 6 years going back to android phone was pretty easy getting used to first of all my personal work phone is an android device having the new pixel 5 and the OS feels right at home - the outer design of pixel 5 was simple man the back texture I thought it was weird at first but its fantastic. Much smoother less jitter true colors. Other features of the iPhone 5s include a 4-inch Retina display AirPlay media streaming Siri voice assistant front facing camera and 4G LTE high-speed data. Once your new iPhone is activated it remains unlocked which means you can use it with any network that provides service for iPhone.</p>
