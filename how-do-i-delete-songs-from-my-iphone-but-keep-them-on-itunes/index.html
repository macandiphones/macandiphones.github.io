Tap an item then tap Play or tap Shuffle to shuffle an album or playlist. Though you would only be able to transfer purchased songs from iPhone to the computer. I see these videos only if I click Recently added.</p>

<p>I see these videos only if I click Recently added. I posted a similar question but dont see how to edit or delete. If you want to sync youll find the setting in the sidebar in Finder. Last few updates have been terrible. 2 all songs are duped.</p>

<p>I see these videos only if I click Recently added. As an example the iPhone 5s technical specification on Apples website lists the supported bitrates for constant rate MP3s as 8 to 320 Kbps. I am trying to sync a playlist from my mac to my iphone 7. Tap Downloaded to view only music stored on iPhone. When I delete songs Id like them to stay deleted.</p>

<p>I have gigs of music downloaded as I dont always have internet. They all play fine on my macBook Pro but when I sync to my phone it only syncs 8 and the remaining 7 show This song is. Windows says it loaded the driver software and now my iPod Touch 4 works. ITunes might be refusing to sync the tracks because they use an encoding format that it knows isnt supported on iOS devices. Dont know what was fixed but certainly made app worse.</p>
