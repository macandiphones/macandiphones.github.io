<p>In comparison renewable energy sources depend on unreliable sources such as wind and solar energy. Geothermal energy is the thermal energy in the Earths crust which originates from the formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions. Join the countrys alternative energy future. The high temperature and pressure in Earths interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically. Heating contributes around a third of the UKs total carbon emissions.</p>

<p>In the energy sector fossil fuel sources have been the main energy source due to their relatively low price. Harvesting biomass for electricity can also help us reduce waste. In comparison renewable energy sources depend on unreliable sources such as wind and solar energy. Food energy is chemical energy that animals including humans derive from their food to sustain their metabolism including their muscular activity. However our energy demand is predicted to rise in the future and we can no longer rely on finite and polluting energy sources.</p>

<p>However our energy demand is predicted to rise in the future and we can no longer rely on finite and polluting energy sources. The environment and alternative energy industries can be significantly affected by government regulations and subsidies changing supply and demand for traditional energy sources and availability of funding for remedial cleanup efforts or development of new technologies and can be subject to risks associated with hazardous materials. So finding an alternative fuel and technology would reduce our carbon footprint significantly. Whether alternative energies such as renewable energies biofuels hydrogen solar and geothermal or the non-renewable nuclear energy can meet energy demands better than finite fossil fuels such as oil and coal remains hotly debated. Solar energy is a great example of renewable energy sources.</p>
