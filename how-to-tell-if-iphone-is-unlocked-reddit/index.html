<p>The 11th generation of the iPhone it was available to pre-order on October 27 2017 and was released on November 3 2017. In my case links to Reddit now open in the browser. Keep in mind that the guys there will tell you if the iPhone can be unlocked and suggest you the best iPhone Unlocking services. The iPhone 8 Plus has a twin-lens camera protruding a little from the back. Apple has included the all-new Liquid Retina LCD as the display on the iPhone XR.</p>
