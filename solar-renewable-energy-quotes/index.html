<p>Timberline Solar certainly impressed judges at CES 2022 in Las Vegas taking out the Best of Innovation Smart Cities award and was named an honoree in Best of Innovation Smart Home. We cannot run out of solar energy unlike some of the other sources of energy. Bringing solar as a renewable energy resource for those who are not able to install solar panels on their roofs allows more communities to benefit from a solar array. In 2015 the target was raised to 100 GW of solar capacity including 40 GW. The solar roof shingles are to be assembled at GAF Energys manufacturing and RD facility in San Jose California.</p>

<p>The sooner we switch away from carbon-based fuel and start relying on renewable energy sources available in the United States the sooner we will grow our economy by creating the millions of new jobs that will come from retrofitting homes and businesses building smart grids renewable energy systems and planting trees and all the rest. We have helped over 30000 Australians discover the most competitive solar energy quotes for their homes. These systems will provide large-scale access to solar energy for both residential and private commercial customers. Estimates suggest that fully harnessing the energy the earth receives from the sun in one hour would satisfy our global energy requirements for one year. The big takeaway.</p>
