<p>One thing differing with this method from uninstalling apps on screen with little x is not only the app itself but also the related documents and data will be permanently removed so it is also useful when you want to free up some space on your overburdened iPhoneiPad. However if you lose any of your iPhone data or unable to recover from the iCloudiTunes use a safe and secure iPhone data recovery tool to get back lost data. The easiest way to do that is to delete your data on the iCloud website. Unlike the above methods you can delete iCloud Documents and Data without deleting the app itself. Faxing might seem outdated but it still has its uses.</p>
