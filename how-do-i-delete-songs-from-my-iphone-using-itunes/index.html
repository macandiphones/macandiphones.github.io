<p>I just wish it didnt add it to my photos in. If prompted choose to Trust This Computer. They all play fine on my macBook Pro but when I sync to my phone it only syncs 8 and the remaining 7 show This song is. Songs that youve purchased may be hidden when you delete them and can be unhidden with iTunes. First you need to import songs from a CD to your iTunes library.</p>

<p>Open iTunes or Apple Music if you are using macOS Catalina or higher. You can do it using your iTunes. Deleting everything off my phone and then resyncing to iTunes but it still has the SAME albums under the grey circle. I have around 3200 songs in my library and not all of the albums sync its says in library that its on my phone but when I search for the songalbum it is not there. If you do a lot of downloading outside the iTunes store songs in your library can get jumbled up leaving you with duplicate albums.</p>
